Performing text analysis of independence speech given by PM Mr.Modi in 2018 and 2017 by using tf-idf method and by simple word count method.
To perform this analysis we have multiple packages like tm(), quanteda(),tidytext() in R. But I have used quanteda package for following reasons.
•	quanteda’s and tidytext’s execution times are very similar as both packages rely on the stringi package for tokenization.
•	This operation takes much longer in tm than in the other two packages.
•	quanteda is much faster than tm in both feature selection and document-feature matrix construction.

Following topics are covered in this text mining exercise.
•	Regular Expression
•	Tokenization
•	Stop word removing
•	Stemming
•	Term frequency and inverse document frequency
•	Visualizing text data
